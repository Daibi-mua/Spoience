### 🎈About Me

- 🎃Spoience——In fact, this word does not exist, but the official translation "Spoiled Innocence" of Lin Youjia's "Innocence and Evil", and later I created a "word" that does not exist by himself (I think it still fits the best rules of English, English pronunciation almost like this: **/spɔiɜ:ns /**)
- 👔I am currently an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Technology🥺
- 🎨I love new things, the internet and Hip-Hop music
- 🎯I rarely play PC or console games, and I only play the mobile game the King of Glory
